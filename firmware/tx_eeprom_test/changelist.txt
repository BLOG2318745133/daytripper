switched to single ADC channel for battery voltage calculation
system clock now 16MHz to allow USB peripheral to function
added rtc sleep function, on-demand delay in stop mode.
reduce power consumption by 15% by putting uC in stop mode while waiting for ToF measurement.


TODO:
re-enable low-battery shutdown
change IWDG timeout prescaler back to 32
add charging detection

current consumption observations:

sparkfun INA169 works really well
during sleep mode current is negligible
laser and nRF both consume around 20mA when active
negligible current difference between 8MHz and 16MHz clock, most of the time MCU is sleeping anyway.
negligible current on low-battery shutdown


USB initialization works only on fresh start-up

the RTC alarm will sleep forever if by the time it enters sleep time has already passed

sleeping changes UART baud rate somehow
